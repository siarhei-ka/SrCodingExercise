# Live Football World Cup Score Board 
version 1

## The scoreboard supports the following operations:
1. Start a new match, assuming initial score 0 â€“ 0 and adding it the scoreboard.
   This should capture following parameters:
   a. Home team
   b. Away team
2. Update score. This should receive a pair of absolute scores: home team score and away
   team score.
3. Finish match currently in progress. This removes a match from the scoreboard.
4. Get a summary of matches in progress ordered by their total score. The matches with the
   same total score will be returned ordered by the most recently started match in the
   scoreboard.
  
## For example, if following matches are started in the specified order and their scores respectively updated:
   1. Mexico 0 - Canada 5
   2. Spain 10 - Brazil 2
   3. Germany 2 - France 2
   4. Uruguay 6 - Italy 6
   5. Argentina 3 - Australia 1
